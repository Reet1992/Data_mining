Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 stars5star Laptop with a 3 star delivery serviceByRohiton 12 January 2018Size: 2TB|Style: core_i7|Verified PurchaseThe laptop looks good. Although the pictures on the site show sliver/white laptop, the laptop I received is Licorice Black. It looks stunning and hence I didn't bother to replace it. Setting up the lappy is quite easy and smooth(although it takes time).1. Built QualityThe laptop is inside an Aluminium Shell and feels as if it's a tank. Although it's not that thin but feels quite sleek in holding. The weight is well balanced. It has a full size  backlight keyboard. The touch pad is huge and responsive.2. ScreenIt as a 15.6 inch full screen display (not IPS). The display is crisp but it has huge bezzels. The bezzels are really huge which is like a black spot in it's beauty. It supports upto 4K videos with ease.3. Boot up speedInitial boot ups were slow (about 30-35 secs) about after the 3rd or 4th boot it was smooth. It took 14 secs to start up the lappy. With fingerprint scanner it took 20 secs to start up.These are very basic impression after 6 hrs of usage.It has fingerprint scanner and it works well. It's swift and a better way to log into the device. The device runs on Windows 10 with 8 Gb Ram and 4gb AMD Graphics. It has a 720p webcam. It comes with MS Office 2016 Student version pre Installed along with 15 months McAfee subscription.One major con of the device is it's smudge attracting outer surface. It catches the  fingerprints and smudges easily. The bezzels also let it down. Overall it's a great laptop with i7 8th gen processor.Strongly recommended for students who prioritize multitasking and prefer light gaming.44 Comments|"

I placed an order for Silver laptop but I have received black one instead.Tried to confirm the colour before it arrives by calling the Amazon customer service, I was misled again saying that I would be getting the colour as promised. However I still got black. On top of that ₹1000 reduced and it became ₹53900 after my order got dispatched and the colour changed to black in my order details, are you kidding me?So I tried to initiate a return but it connected me to the technical support team which took 1 and half hour of my time to explain and make the technician understand that I have been given a wrong product.And he was never accepting that I was misled than saying that colour might change as it was not in the option.My question when you look at a product image as silver and there is no option to change the colour, would you think u will get black instead of Silver and why should I pay ₹54900 +₹100 delivery to get something which I have never ordered? Is it your your choice or Amazon's choice to let you use what they want for ₹55000?Thinking I can give a try on this laptop, I opened it but to my surprise this laptop lags a lot even with a good configuration which is a brand new laptop. Everytime when I click on any icon, it froze and it breaks the pixels while watching any video and display is not as expected. As I worked for Dell, I did some troubleshooting like cleaning cookies, doing disk cleanup and disk defragmentation but still no go.Overall it's not worth the money and the brand name.Only pro is, it got finger print sensor which is a little advanced technology. Otherwise NO NO for this price and NO NO for the experience.0Comment|"

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 stars5star Laptop with a 3 star delivery serviceByRohiton 12 January 2018Size: 2TB|Style: core_i7|Verified PurchaseThe laptop looks good. Although the pictures on the site show sliver/white laptop, the laptop I received is Licorice Black. It looks stunning and hence I didn't bother to replace it. Setting up the lappy is quite easy and smooth(although it takes time).1. Built QualityThe laptop is inside an Aluminium Shell and feels as if it's a tank. Although it's not that thin but feels quite sleek in holding. The weight is well balanced. It has a full size  backlight keyboard. The touch pad is huge and responsive.2. ScreenIt as a 15.6 inch full screen display (not IPS). The display is crisp but it has huge bezzels. The bezzels are really huge which is like a black spot in it's beauty. It supports upto 4K videos with ease.3. Boot up speedInitial boot ups were slow (about 30-35 secs) about after the 3rd or 4th boot it was smooth. It took 14 secs to start up the lappy. With fingerprint scanner it took 20 secs to start up.These are very basic impression after 6 hrs of usage.It has fingerprint scanner and it works well. It's swift and a better way to log into the device. The device runs on Windows 10 with 8 Gb Ram and 4gb AMD Graphics. It has a 720p webcam. It comes with MS Office 2016 Student version pre Installed along with 15 months McAfee subscription.One major con of the device is it's smudge attracting outer surface. It catches the  fingerprints and smudges easily. The bezzels also let it down. Overall it's a great laptop with i7 8th gen processor.Strongly recommended for students who prioritize multitasking and prefer light gaming.44 Comments|"

I placed an order for Silver laptop but I have received black one instead.Tried to confirm the colour before it arrives by calling the Amazon customer service, I was misled again saying that I would be getting the colour as promised. However I still got black. On top of that ₹1000 reduced and it became ₹53900 after my order got dispatched and the colour changed to black in my order details, are you kidding me?So I tried to initiate a return but it connected me to the technical support team which took 1 and half hour of my time to explain and make the technician understand that I have been given a wrong product.And he was never accepting that I was misled than saying that colour might change as it was not in the option.My question when you look at a product image as silver and there is no option to change the colour, would you think u will get black instead of Silver and why should I pay ₹54900 +₹100 delivery to get something which I have never ordered? Is it your your choice or Amazon's choice to let you use what they want for ₹55000?Thinking I can give a try on this laptop, I opened it but to my surprise this laptop lags a lot even with a good configuration which is a brand new laptop. Everytime when I click on any icon, it froze and it breaks the pixels while watching any video and display is not as expected. As I worked for Dell, I did some troubleshooting like cleaning cookies, doing disk cleanup and disk defragmentation but still no go.Overall it's not worth the money and the brand name.Only pro is, it got finger print sensor which is a little advanced technology. Otherwise NO NO for this price and NO NO for the experience.0Comment|"

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 stars5star Laptop with a 3 star delivery serviceByRohiton 12 January 2018Size: 2TB|Style: core_i7|Verified PurchaseThe laptop looks good. Although the pictures on the site show sliver/white laptop, the laptop I received is Licorice Black. It looks stunning and hence I didn't bother to replace it. Setting up the lappy is quite easy and smooth(although it takes time).1. Built QualityThe laptop is inside an Aluminium Shell and feels as if it's a tank. Although it's not that thin but feels quite sleek in holding. The weight is well balanced. It has a full size  backlight keyboard. The touch pad is huge and responsive.2. ScreenIt as a 15.6 inch full screen display (not IPS). The display is crisp but it has huge bezzels. The bezzels are really huge which is like a black spot in it's beauty. It supports upto 4K videos with ease.3. Boot up speedInitial boot ups were slow (about 30-35 secs) about after the 3rd or 4th boot it was smooth. It took 14 secs to start up the lappy. With fingerprint scanner it took 20 secs to start up.These are very basic impression after 6 hrs of usage.It has fingerprint scanner and it works well. It's swift and a better way to log into the device. The device runs on Windows 10 with 8 Gb Ram and 4gb AMD Graphics. It has a 720p webcam. It comes with MS Office 2016 Student version pre Installed along with 15 months McAfee subscription.One major con of the device is it's smudge attracting outer surface. It catches the  fingerprints and smudges easily. The bezzels also let it down. Overall it's a great laptop with i7 8th gen processor.Strongly recommended for students who prioritize multitasking and prefer light gaming.44 Comments|"

Please try again later.1.0 out of 5 stars***Wrong colour sent*** Bad choice & Extremely dissatisfied.ByJannaton 11 March 2018Size: 1TB|Style: core_i5|Verified PurchaseI have always been a Dell user for the past 8 years as I worked for Dell Technical Support however Amazon is misleading customers into buying a bad Dell product. I placed an order for Silver laptop but I have received black one instead.Tried to confirm the colour before it arrives by calling the Amazon customer service, I was misled again saying that I would be getting the colour as promised. However I still got black. On top of that ₹1000 reduced and it became ₹53900 after my order got dispatched and the colour changed to black in my order details, are you kidding me?So I tried to initiate a return but it connected me to the technical support team which took 1 and half hour of my time to explain and make the technician understand that I have been given a wrong product.And he was never accepting that I was misled than saying that colour might change as it was not in the option.My question when you look at a product image as silver and there is no option to change the colour, would you think u will get black instead of Silver and why should I pay ₹54900 +₹100 delivery to get something which I have never ordered? Is it your your choice or Amazon's choice to let you use what they want for ₹55000?Thinking I can give a try on this laptop, I opened it but to my surprise this laptop lags a lot even with a good configuration which is a brand new laptop. Everytime when I click on any icon, it froze and it breaks the pixels while watching any video and display is not as expected. As I worked for Dell, I did some troubleshooting like cleaning cookies, doing disk cleanup and disk defragmentation but still no go.Overall it's not worth the money and the brand name.Only pro is, it got finger print sensor which is a little advanced technology. Otherwise NO NO for this price and NO NO for the experience.0Comment|"
